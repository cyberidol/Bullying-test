# bullying-test
This is an advanced web design assignment, which involves creating a fictional anti-bullying website. The website is composed of five main sections.

Homepage: This section includes navigation links to the other four sections, as well as a "Get Help" form.
Interactive Zone: A separate area designed to help children who are being bullied understand whether they are experiencing bullying, using an educational and fun approach. 
3-5. Parents, Teachers, and Health Experts Sections: These sections focus more on providing informational assistance rather than emotional support. They aim to offer different resources, including external links and helplines, to help these groups collaborate in addressing bullying.
This website is a student project, and all images have been generated by GPT. If anyone is interested in further development of the website, it is possible to collaborate and replace the GPT-generated content. The website includes a video link from the Anti-Bullying Squad, referenced below:
